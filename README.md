This is a public Web Development Portfolio. 
To View my Mobile App Development Portfolio please send me a message and I will send it to you.

Feel free to look at it and ask me any questions. Thank you.
I am spending 3 months learning web development - self taught.

I took 2 years of community courses in Computer Science and got my Certificate in C.S but I did not learn the right skills to land a job. Thus, I will be aiming towards the self taught route and applying for jobs and hoping to learn directly on the job if I am hired as a Software Developer. This portfolio will be solely based on python,html,css and javascript but I am willing to learn other languages that are required for other positions as well.
